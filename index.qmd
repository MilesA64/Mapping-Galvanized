Welcome to the Mapping Galvanization Project! This project is designed to help visitors understand and provide visual analysis for the Civil War phenomenon known as "galvanization." This site was built as part of the Spring 2024 HIST 5454 Digital History course, designed to showcase our abilities and conceptualize possible uses of historical data.

## Background

The Civil War phenomena of galvanization remains an extremely understudied part of the Civil War and of the particular sub field of Civil War prison history. Within the context of the war, it refers to when soldiers with prisoner of war status made the choice to enlist in their captors army. As such, Galvanized "Yankees" are former Confederate soldiers that enlisted in the United States Army, and Galvanized "Confederates" are former Union soldiers that joined the Confederate Army. While the prevalence of galvanized Yankees was more prominent, as many former Confederates went on to garrison U.S. Army forts in the Midwestern borderland, the role and activity of galvanized Confederates is much less known and generally understudied.

The extant historiography of galvanization reflects the limited amount of research done, and the future possibilities for this topic. Dee Brown's *Galvanized Yankees*, published in 1963, explores the experiences of former Confederates while these men protected white settlers on the frontier. Michelle Tucker Butt's *Galvanized Yankees on the Upper Mississippi*, delves deeper than Brown, and even some discussion of galvanized Yankees that were in occupied Confederate territory. However, both books barely scratch the surface of the galvanized Confederate experience. Published in 2020, Patrick Garrow's *Changing Sides: Union Prisoners of War Who Joined the Confederate Army* is the first to prioritize galvanized Confederate experiences. Writing from an archaeological background, Garrow's writing provides ample detail about the activities of Galvanized Confederate units and officers, but no broader arguments about the units themselves nor the specific experiences of regular soldiers. 2024 has seen the most recent publication of galvanized literature. Glen Swain's *The Forgotten Mutineers: The Story of Brooks' Battalion* uses a combination of personal papers and regimental histories to build the world and experiences of the Union soldiers that enlisted with the Confederate army, and in the case of Brooks' Battalion of galvanized, to recount their heroic attempted mutiny. **The goal of my research and this project is to continue what I see as a steady pace of interest and research into the experiences of galvanized. These men made difficult choices between survival and loyalty. Understanding these individuals reveals the complexities and complications of Civil War era citizenship, militarism, relationships, nationalism, and many other factors.**

## Technical Aims

This project is aimed at showing how mapping is a viable means of reaching historical conclusions about galvanized Confederates. These men came from a variety of backgrounds and locations - in line with Confederate policy. By mapping these locations out and determining concentrations or affiliations - we can see where loyalty bonds might be looser or less defined.
